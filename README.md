# EcoSphereLab
EcoSphereLab: Website and resources for imagery-based biodiversity impact assessment near a local industrial refinery in Commerce City, CO.


EcoSphere Lab
Imagery-Based Quantification of Biodiversity Impacts
near a Local Industrial Refinery, Commerce City, Colorado


Project Overview
EcoSphere Lab leverages drone, aerial, and satellite imagery—alongside historical GIS datasets and minimal field validation—to quantify how chronic pollution from a local industrial refinery has altered biodiversity in riparian and prairie ecosystems around Commerce City, CO. By comparing imagery-derived metrics at impacted sites to nearby protected reference areas, we produce high-resolution maps of vegetation health, habitat fragmentation, wetland extent, and long-term change detection to inform local restoration and environmental justice efforts.
